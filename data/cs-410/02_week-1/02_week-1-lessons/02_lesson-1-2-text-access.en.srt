00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:09,434
[SOUND]

2
00:00:09,434 --> 00:00:12,223
In this lecture, 
we're going to talk about the text access.

3
00:00:14,279 --> 00:00:18,349
In the previous lecture, we talked about
the natural language content, analysis.

4
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:23,970
We explained that the state of the are
natural language processing techniques

5
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:28,970
are still not good enough to process
a lot of unrestricted text data

6
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:30,550
in a robust manner.

7
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:31,360
As a result,

8
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:37,250
bag of words remains very popular in
applications like a search engine.

9
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:44,100
In this lecture, we're going to talk
about some high-level strategies to

10
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:48,120
help users get access to the text data.

11
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:55,000
This is also important step to convert
raw big text data into small random data.

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,610
That are actually needed
in a specific application.

13
00:00:57,610 --> 00:01:02,510
So the main question we'll address here,
is how

14
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:07,450
can a text information system, help users
get access to the relevant text data?

15
00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:11,550
We're going to cover two complimentary
strategies, push versus pull.

16
00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:17,700
And then we're going to talk about
two ways to implement the pull mode,

17
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:19,080
querying versus browsing.

18
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:22,860
So first push versus pull.

19
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:29,250
These are two different ways connect
the users with the right information

20
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:29,900
at the right time.

21
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:35,900
The difference is which
takes the initiative,

22
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:38,740
which party takes the initiative.

23
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:41,380
In the pull mode,

24
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:46,439
the users take the initiative to
start the information access process.

25
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:53,420
And in this case, a user typically would
use a search engine to fulfill the goal.

26
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:56,100
For example,
the user may type in the query and

27
00:01:56,100 --> 00:02:01,640
then browse the results to
find the relevant information.

28
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:06,280
So this is usually appropriate for

29
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:09,340
satisfying a user's ad
hoc information need.

30
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:14,280
An ad hoc information need is
a temporary information need.

31
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:17,870
For example, you want to buy a product so

32
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:22,550
you suddenly have a need to read
reviews about related product.

33
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:26,620
But after you have cracked information,
you have purchased in your product.

34
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:28,880
You generally no longer
need such information, so

35
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,200
it's a temporary information need.

36
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:35,230
In such a case, it's very hard for
a system to predict your need, and

37
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:39,480
it's more proper for
the users to take the initiative, and

38
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:42,260
that's why search engines are very useful.

39
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:48,370
Today because many people have many
information needs all the time.

40
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:52,620
So as we're speaking Google is probably
processing many queries from this.

41
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:55,720
And those are all, or mostly adequate.

42
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:56,590
Information needs.

43
00:02:57,950 --> 00:02:59,680
So this is a pull mode.

44
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,570
In contrast in the push mode in
the system would take the initiative

45
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:07,510
to push the information to the user or
to recommend information to the user.

46
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:11,090
So in this case this is usually
supported by a recommender system.

47
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:15,190
Now this would be appropriate if.

48
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:16,900
The user has a stable information.

49
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:22,040
For example you may have a research
interest in some topic and

50
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:24,980
that interest tends to stay for a while.

51
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:26,930
So, it's rather stable.

52
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:29,240
Your hobby is another example of.

53
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:34,100
A stable information need is such a case
the system can interact with you and

54
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:38,860
can learn your interest, and
then to monitor the information stream.

55
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:43,710
If the system hasn't seen any
relevant items to your interest,

56
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:47,900
the system could then take the initiative
to recommend the information to you.

57
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:49,940
So, for example, a news filter or

58
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:53,020
news recommended system could
monitor the news stream and

59
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:56,870
identify interesting news to you and
simply push the news articles to you.

60
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:03,960
This mode of information access may be
also a property that when this system

61
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:08,790
has good knowledge about the users need
and this happens in the search context.

62
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:11,850
So for example, when you search for
information on the web

63
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:16,130
a search engine might infer you might be
also interested in something related.

64
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:17,530
Formation.

65
00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:20,950
And they would recommend the information
to you, so that just reminds you, for

66
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:24,780
example, of an advertisement
placed on the search page.

67
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:34,540
So this is about the two high level
strategies or two modes of text access.

68
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:38,440
Now let's look at the pull
mode in more detail.

69
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:43,740
In the pull mode, we can further
distinguish it two ways to help users.

70
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:46,010
Querying versus browsing.

71
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:48,790
In querying,
a user would just enter a query.

72
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:50,560
Typical the keyword query, and

73
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,430
the search engine system would
return relevant documents to use.

74
00:04:54,500 --> 00:05:00,730
And this works well when the user knows
what exactly are the keywords to be used.

75
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:02,450
So if you know exactly
what you are looking for,

76
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:04,540
you tend to know the right keywords.

77
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:07,880
And then query works very well,
and we do that all of the time.

78
00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:12,740
But we also know that sometimes
it doesn't work so well.

79
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:16,970
When you don't know the right
keywords to use in the query, or

80
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:21,760
you want to browse information
in some topic area.

81
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:24,780
You use because browsing
would be more useful.

82
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:29,890
So in this case, in the case of browsing,
the users would simply navigate it,

83
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:33,330
into the relevant information
by following the paths

84
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:39,850
supported by the structures of documents.

85
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:42,690
So the system would maintain
some kind of structures and

86
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:45,190
then the user could follow
these structures to navigate.

87
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:53,850
So this really works well when the user
wants to explore the information space

88
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:59,750
or the user doesn't know what
are the keywords to using the query.

89
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:05,070
Or simply because the user finds it
inconvenient to type in a query.

90
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:10,450
So even if a user knows what query to
type in if the user is using a cellphone

91
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:12,370
to search for information.

92
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:14,760
It's still harder to enter the query.

93
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:18,840
In such a case, again,
browsing tends to be more convenient.

94
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:23,060
The relationship between browsing and
querying is best understood by making and

95
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:24,130
imagine you're site seeing.

96
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:27,080
Imagine if you're touring a city.

97
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:29,800
Now if you know the exact
address of attraction.

98
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:34,900
Taking a taxi there is
perhaps the fastest way.

99
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:36,860
You can go directly to the site.

100
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:40,440
But if you don't know the exact address,
you may need to walk around.

101
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:43,579
Or you can take a taxi to a nearby
place and then walk around.

102
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:48,160
It turns out that we do exactly
the same in the information studies.

103
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:51,480
If you know exactly what you
are looking for, then you can

104
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:55,360
use the right keywords in your query
to find the information you're after.

105
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,150
That's usually the fastest way to do,
find information.

106
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:02,180
But what if you don't know
the exact keywords to use?

107
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:04,369
Well, you clearly probably won't so well.

108
00:07:04,369 --> 00:07:06,150
You will not related pages.

109
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:10,160
And then, you need to also walk
around in the information space,

110
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:14,110
meaning by following the links or
by browsing.

111
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:16,430
You can then finally get
into the relevant page.

112
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:20,720
If you want to learn about again.

113
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:24,610
You will likely do a lot of browsing so

114
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:29,914
just like you are looking around in
some area and you want to see some

115
00:07:29,914 --> 00:07:36,405
interesting attractions
related in the same.

116
00:07:36,405 --> 00:07:39,200
[INAUDIBLE].

117
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:45,330
So this analogy also tells us that
today we have very good support for

118
00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:50,600
query, but we don't really have
good support for browsing.

119
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:54,470
And this is because in order
to browse effectively,

120
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:57,840
we need a map to guide us,
just like you need a map to.

121
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:58,410
Of Chicago,

122
00:07:58,410 --> 00:08:04,060
through the city of Chicago, you need a
topical map to tour the information space.

123
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:08,190
So how to construct such a topical
map is in fact a very interesting

124
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:12,730
research question that might bring us

125
00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:16,950
more interesting browsing experience
on the web or in applications.

126
00:08:19,170 --> 00:08:21,280
So, to summarize this lecture,

127
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:26,550
we've talked about the two high level
strategies for text access; push and pull.

128
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:29,130
Push tends to be supported by
the Recommender System, and

129
00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:31,770
Pull tends to be supported
by the Search Engine.

130
00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:35,710
Of course, in the sophisticated
[INAUDIBLE] information system,

131
00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:36,780
we should combine the two.

132
00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:41,830
In the pull mode, we can further this
[INAUDIBLE] Querying and Browsing.

133
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:47,140
Again we generally want to combine
the two ways to help you assist,

134
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:50,080
so that you can support
the both querying nad browsing.

135
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:55,420
If you want to know more about
the relationship between pull and

136
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:58,600
push, you can read this article.

137
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:03,560
This give excellent discussion of the
relationship between machine filtering and

138
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:05,330
information retrieval.

139
00:09:05,330 --> 00:09:10,271
Here informational filtering is similar
to information recommendation or

140
00:09:10,271 --> 00:09:12,749
the push mode of information access.

141
00:09:12,749 --> 00:09:22,749
