  Week 1 Overview
 </h1>
 <p>
  The first six weeks of the course are based on the content of the Text Retrieval and Search Engines MOOC. During this week's lessons, you will learn the overall design of this MOOC, an overview of natural language
processing techniques, which are the foundation for all kinds of
text-processing applications, the concept of a retrieval model, and the basic
idea of the vector space model.

  Goals and Objectives
 </h2>
 <p>
  After you actively engage
in the learning experiences in this module, you should be able to:
 </p>
 <ul bullettype="bullets">
  <li>
   <p>
    Explain some basic concepts in natural language processing, text
information access.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Explain why text retrieval is often defined as a ranking problem.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Explain the basic idea of the vector space retrieval model and
how to instantiate it with the simplest bit-vector representation.
   </p>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <h2 level="2">
  Guiding Questions
 </h2>
 <p>
  Develop your answers to the following guiding questions while watching the video lectures throughout the week.

  Tips for Success
 </h2>
 <p>
  To do well this week, I recommend that you do the following:
 </p>
 <ul bullettype="bullets">
  <li>
   <p>
    Review the video lectures a number of times to gain a solid understanding of the key questions and concepts introduced this week.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    When possible, provide tips and suggestions to your peers in this class. As a learning community, we can help each other learn and grow. One way of doing this is by helping to address the questions that your peers pose. By engaging with each other, we’ll all learn better.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    It’s always a good idea to refer to the video lectures and chapter readings we've read during this week and reference them in your responses. When appropriate, critique the information presented.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Take notes while you read the materials and watch the lectures for this week. By taking notes, you are interacting with the material and will find that it is easier to remember and to understand. With your notes, you’ll also find that it’s easier to complete your assignments. So, go ahead, do yourself a favor; take some notes!
   </p>
  </li>
