00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,420
Hello welcome to CS410 DSO Text Information Systems.

2
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:10,840
This is an online course offered by University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

3
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:12,750
My name is ChengXiang Zhai.

4
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:14,920
I also have a nickname, Cheng.

5
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:20,050
I'm a professor of Computer Science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

6
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:22,800
I'm the instructor of this course.

7
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:27,560
This first lecture is just an introduction to the course.

8
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:31,000
Let's first to start with some motivation.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:38,165
The problem we are trying to address in this course is how to harness big text data.

10
00:00:38,165 --> 00:00:41,382
Text data is all kinds of data in

11
00:00:41,382 --> 00:00:47,100
the form of natural languages such as English and Chinese.

12
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:52,200
Now, this kind of data is everywhere and also growing very quickly.

13
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,390
For example, you can find all kinds of

14
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:58,300
web pages on the Internet and the number of pages is growing quickly.

15
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:01,995
You can also find the blogs articles, news articles,

16
00:01:01,995 --> 00:01:07,540
or Emails and other kind of documents and enterprise environment.

17
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:12,470
Of course, we will also have a lot of scientific literature in text form.

18
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:16,250
And nowadays, social media has been growing quickly.

19
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:21,675
So we now see, tweets and other social media data also in the form of text.

20
00:01:21,675 --> 00:01:27,709
All such text data encode a lot of useful knowledge about the world

21
00:01:27,709 --> 00:01:35,360
because it's in some sense the data reported by human census about the observe the world.

22
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:41,115
So we can analyzed this kind of data to discover a lot of useful knowledge.

23
00:01:41,115 --> 00:01:47,565
Especially the knowledge about the human opinions or preferences.

24
00:01:47,565 --> 00:01:51,420
So this kind of data is very useful and we can use

25
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:55,725
computational methods to turn such data into useful knowledge,

26
00:01:55,725 --> 00:02:00,870
which can then be further used in many applications.

27
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:09,470
The main techniques for making this happen include the Text Retrieval and Text Mining.

28
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:13,030
And these are the main techniques that we will cover in this course.

29
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:16,745
Logically, in order to make use a lot of text data.

30
00:02:16,745 --> 00:02:19,225
We would first do text retrieval,

31
00:02:19,225 --> 00:02:23,670
and that's due to a large set of text data

32
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:28,995
into a smaller but much more relevant set of data,

33
00:02:28,995 --> 00:02:32,577
that we actually need for a particular problem.

34
00:02:32,577 --> 00:02:35,790
And this step, is usually implemented by

35
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:39,300
using text retrieval techniques that involve humans in

36
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:46,665
the loop to find and locate the most relevant documents to a particular problem.

37
00:02:46,665 --> 00:02:49,900
Once we find the relevant documents,

38
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:52,467
the next step is to do text mining,

39
00:02:52,467 --> 00:02:57,090
which is to further analyze the found of relevant documents to

40
00:02:57,090 --> 00:02:59,785
discover useful knowledge to extract

41
00:02:59,785 --> 00:03:03,240
the knowledge that can be directly used in application,

42
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:06,408
especially in a application such as decision making.

43
00:03:06,408 --> 00:03:14,445
These two steps corresponding to Text Retrieval and Text Mining Techniques,

44
00:03:14,445 --> 00:03:20,968
that we will cover in this course.

45
00:03:20,968 --> 00:03:23,880
Based on this picture that I show you,

46
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:31,110
this course is designed to leverage to corresponding books that I've offered on Coursera,

47
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:34,665
which cover Text Retrieval and Text Mining respectively.

48
00:03:34,665 --> 00:03:36,420
The first book is called,

49
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:38,515
Text Retrieval and Search Engines.

50
00:03:38,515 --> 00:03:39,895
The second book is called,

51
00:03:39,895 --> 00:03:41,275
the Text Mining and Analytics.

52
00:03:41,275 --> 00:03:44,400
These two books have

53
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,165
comprehensive lecture videos that cover

54
00:03:48,165 --> 00:03:49,980
basic concepts and principles and

55
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:53,915
methods for text retrieval and text mining respectively.

56
00:03:53,915 --> 00:03:56,405
So, this online course,

57
00:03:56,405 --> 00:04:00,360
will leverage all those lecture videos and also

58
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:05,455
the online quizzes that are provided through the Coursera platform.

59
00:04:05,455 --> 00:04:07,170
But in addition to that,

60
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:15,270
we also need to add additional components in order to explore applications because

61
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:19,013
those books have covered a general techniques without a necessary discussing in depths

62
00:04:19,013 --> 00:04:24,670
how those techniques are using applications.

63
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:30,200
So, to make the coverage more complete in CS410,

64
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:33,620
we were adding two additional components as shown here.

65
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:37,415
That is of course Products and Technology Review.

66
00:04:37,415 --> 00:04:45,990
Both are meant to give the students freedom to choose a particular way to apply some of

67
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:50,430
the techniques that you have learned in those two books to solve

68
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:56,635
a real world problem or to further learn about a particular topic.

69
00:04:56,635 --> 00:05:01,200
In the project, you will have opportunities to apply the knowledge that you have

70
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:08,337
learned in those two books to solve a real world problem in an integrated manner.

71
00:05:08,337 --> 00:05:11,070
In technical review, you can leverage what you have

72
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:14,960
learned to learn even more about either tool kit

73
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,760
or a particular technology that can be

74
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:25,355
used to extend your knowledge about how to solve a problem.

75
00:05:25,355 --> 00:05:31,605
The format of the course thus is a mixture of online videos plus

76
00:05:31,605 --> 00:05:35,055
some high engagement module which mostly consists of

77
00:05:35,055 --> 00:05:40,475
our interactions through forums as I will explain later.

78
00:05:40,475 --> 00:05:45,120
And also, we will have a lot of interactions to help you

79
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:50,043
finish the course Project and Technology Review.

80
00:05:50,043 --> 00:05:53,160
There are a number of goals that we

81
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:56,280
have kept in mind when designing this course and I want to share with

82
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:59,100
you these goals because they would help you understand

83
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:02,070
why the course has this particular format and

84
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:10,310
why you are asked to do certain components of the tasks.

85
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:15,650
The first goal is we want to emphasize both theory and practice.

86
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:19,350
Theory is obviously very important because the basic concepts and

87
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:26,135
general principles covering the theoretical part would be applicable to all applications.

88
00:06:26,135 --> 00:06:29,445
That means, they are not just used for

89
00:06:29,445 --> 00:06:34,815
today's applications but they can be used for solving future problems as well so,

90
00:06:34,815 --> 00:06:36,230
they are more general.

91
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:41,470
Therefore, they have long lasting impact and utility value.

92
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:45,195
And this is achieved by having you to watch all the lecture videos,

93
00:06:45,195 --> 00:06:49,080
and then to use quizzes and exams to make sure

94
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:53,110
that you have mastered all the basic ideas,

95
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:58,830
basic concepts and general principles and those general methods.

96
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:02,773
Practical skills are also very important,

97
00:07:02,773 --> 00:07:07,485
and because of specific practical skills can be immediately useful for solving

98
00:07:07,485 --> 00:07:10,230
the problems today and maybe you will be able to

99
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:13,945
resolve the problems that you encountered in your job.

100
00:07:13,945 --> 00:07:18,640
And this is achieved by having you to do Programming assignments,

101
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:22,660
where you would be able to use existing tool kits,

102
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:27,090
to look into some algorithms in depths and to use some of

103
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:33,790
the algorithms to have some sense about how they work or how to improve them.

104
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:38,235
And finally, of course it's very important to integrate the theory and practice.

105
00:07:38,235 --> 00:07:39,637
And this will be done by,

106
00:07:39,637 --> 00:07:43,365
having you to work on Course projects.

107
00:07:43,365 --> 00:07:48,060
The second goal is to Personalized Learning,

108
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:55,815
because every one of you has a different in need and different in preference,

109
00:07:55,815 --> 00:07:59,970
and you will have a different in schedules as well,

110
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:04,440
because many of you are full time workers, perhaps.

111
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:09,500
And so, Personalized Learning is very important to ensure

112
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:16,635
everyone to receive the best education.

113
00:08:16,635 --> 00:08:18,645
So to achieve this goal,

114
00:08:18,645 --> 00:08:22,285
we have intentionally designed

115
00:08:22,285 --> 00:08:26,520
the deadlines and the format of the course to be flexible so that,

116
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:30,780
you can have a lot of freedom to do self-paced learning.

117
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:36,345
For example, you can watch over the lecture videos at anytime that you want to.

118
00:08:36,345 --> 00:08:38,430
Watch it, watch that.

119
00:08:38,430 --> 00:08:42,010
And you can also finish all the quizzes pretty much

120
00:08:42,010 --> 00:08:47,160
anytime and you can do the assignment,

121
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:53,100
program assigns particularly again in a flexible way.

122
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:56,690
In addition to self paced learning,

123
00:08:56,690 --> 00:09:02,541
you would also have a choices of topics for project and the technology review.

124
00:09:02,541 --> 00:09:07,350
And you will be able to work on a topic that's most interesting to you,

125
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:11,960
for both course project and technology review.

126
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:15,230
Finally, we also have the goal of

127
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:20,190
collaborative learning because this would maximize the efficiency of learning.

128
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:25,730
Our common goal is to help everyone learn maximum amount of knowledge,

129
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:29,895
while spending hopefully minimum amount of effort.

130
00:09:29,895 --> 00:09:34,625
So, this is a common goal that we should all work toward,

131
00:09:34,625 --> 00:09:38,135
and we should help each other achieve this goal.

132
00:09:38,135 --> 00:09:44,014
To promote collaborative learning and to facilitate collaborative learning,

133
00:09:44,014 --> 00:09:50,855
we will use forum-based interactions to enable all of us,

134
00:09:50,855 --> 00:09:53,465
including many of you from different time zones,

135
00:09:53,465 --> 00:09:56,975
to interact with each other effectively.

136
00:09:56,975 --> 00:10:05,360
Another way to support a collaborative learning is to have you to work in groups,

137
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:08,950
to finish cost projects and technology reviews.

138
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:11,240
So, both technology reviews and

139
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:18,085
products can be done by working together with others in a group.

140
00:10:18,085 --> 00:10:25,495
So, overall the format is as follows: first,

141
00:10:25,495 --> 00:10:30,521
you will have to watch the lecture videos of those two MOOCs,

142
00:10:30,521 --> 00:10:34,120
and this is also shown here on this slide,

143
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:38,100
and then you also need to take quizzes.

144
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:40,590
And these quizzes are given in a weekly manner.

145
00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:43,375
But as I said, the deadlines are actually flexible.

146
00:10:43,375 --> 00:10:47,530
So, you should be able to finish quizzes as soon as you

147
00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:52,190
finish the corresponding lecture videos.

148
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:55,685
These quizzes are two.

149
00:10:55,685 --> 00:10:59,085
There are also two kinds of quizzes.

150
00:10:59,085 --> 00:11:05,810
There are practice quizzes that you can use to help you understand some concepts.

151
00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:09,040
And there are also test quizzes.

152
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:15,010
Those are of course to make sure that you have indeed mastered the materials.

153
00:11:15,010 --> 00:11:16,480
Then there are two exams.

154
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:23,270
Those two exams will be given at the end of each MOOC corresponding.

155
00:11:23,270 --> 00:11:30,010
So, the first exam will be given at the end of the first MOOC on Test Retrieval,

156
00:11:30,010 --> 00:11:36,620
and the second one will be given at the end of the second MOOC on Test Mining.

157
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:40,445
And then, during this period of watching these videos,

158
00:11:40,445 --> 00:11:44,020
you will be also working on programming assignments.

159
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:47,130
Then at the end of the semester,

160
00:11:47,130 --> 00:11:52,735
we'll leave about two weeks time for you to work intensively on the course project,

161
00:11:52,735 --> 00:11:57,730
although you will be working on the course project throughout the semester.

162
00:11:57,730 --> 00:12:04,950
But most of the time will be in the end of the semester.

163
00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:12,850
Now, the course project will be down sequentially by following multiple steps.

164
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:15,235
The first is for you to select a topic.

165
00:12:15,235 --> 00:12:17,920
You can select the topic from a list of topics that

166
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:20,740
we provide or you can propose your topic,

167
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:23,540
and then we'll ask you to submit

168
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:28,120
a short proposal to be more specific about what you want to work on.

169
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:30,175
And then, in the middle of the semester,

170
00:12:30,175 --> 00:12:32,980
you will be asked to provide

171
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:35,680
a short progress report so that we can check

172
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:39,495
your progress and we can provide help in a timely manner.

173
00:12:39,495 --> 00:12:41,650
And then, at the end of the semester,

174
00:12:41,650 --> 00:12:49,040
you will deliver two things: one is a software and its documentation.

175
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:55,820
You upload that to a public website so that it's available to people.

176
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:57,920
The second one is a tutorial presentation,

177
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:04,385
a short presentation to explain how your software can be used by people.

178
00:13:04,385 --> 00:13:11,480
There is also a technology review component which is mandatory and

179
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:18,180
this component will be correlated based on completion.

180
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:22,645
Everyone is required to finish this component.

181
00:13:22,645 --> 00:13:26,070
Now, this component is designed to give you

182
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:30,630
an opportunity to explore further any topic that you're interested in.

183
00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:35,755
This can be in that examination of a tool kit that you are interested in,

184
00:13:35,755 --> 00:13:39,095
perhaps a tool that you have used in the course project,

185
00:13:39,095 --> 00:13:43,550
or a comparison of multiple tools that can do similar things,

186
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:46,050
and you might have looked into multiple tools,

187
00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:55,950
and you have some opportunity to compare them and to figure out which one is the best.

188
00:13:55,950 --> 00:13:59,780
Such a writing would be helpful for others to understand how to

189
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:04,210
use a tool kit or which one to choose.

190
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:08,360
Of course, those of you who are interested in the methods,

191
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:11,870
you can also go in-depth to examine a certain type

192
00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:15,725
of methods and write a brief review of them,

193
00:14:15,725 --> 00:14:20,210
or looking to a cutting edge topic in your research and write

194
00:14:20,210 --> 00:14:26,250
a review of the recent papers about the topic.

195
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:29,020
Now, we hope that you might be able to align

196
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:33,980
the technology review with your course project so that the two will

197
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:38,330
be kind of synergistic in that technology review will help

198
00:14:38,330 --> 00:14:44,040
you learn more about the topic related to your course project,

199
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:48,600
while the course project will give you also a motivation for doing

200
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:54,745
an in-depth study of the topic via technology review.

201
00:14:54,745 --> 00:15:00,770
Of course, we will try to help you finish all these tasks,

202
00:15:00,770 --> 00:15:03,000
and we'll do our best to help you.

203
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:08,865
That means, the TAs and I will interact with you in various ways to help you,

204
00:15:08,865 --> 00:15:13,725
and one way is a synchronous question answering and discussing via forums.

205
00:15:13,725 --> 00:15:16,400
And the other way is to have

206
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:25,610
synchronous weekly office hours and that will be down by using video teleconferencing.

207
00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:33,265
The grading will be done as follows: 25% of your grade will be based on the quizzes,

208
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:37,075
all the quizzes for the two MOOCs;

209
00:15:37,075 --> 00:15:39,655
30% will be based on the two exams,

210
00:15:39,655 --> 00:15:43,740
those two exams will be proctored exams;

211
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:48,560
25% will be based on the programming assignments,

212
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:52,115
there will be multiple programming assignments throughout the semester.

213
00:15:52,115 --> 00:15:59,270
The remaining 20% will be based on your course project and that's for

214
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:05,965
the distribution as follows: 5% is for topic selection,

215
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:07,760
5% is for proposal,

216
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:11,280
and another 5% for progress report,

217
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:20,080
65% in most of the grade of the course project will be based on software deposit,

218
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:23,885
your deliverable for the project.

219
00:16:23,885 --> 00:16:28,495
And finally, 20% is based on the tutorial presentation.

220
00:16:28,495 --> 00:16:34,610
Now, most of these components in the course project will be graded based on completion.

221
00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:38,000
Indeed, a lot of tasks you see in programming assignments are graded in

222
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,710
the same way and that is because we believe we have

223
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:46,955
designed the program assignments and course project in such a way

224
00:16:46,955 --> 00:16:54,405
that you will be able to learn a lot by simply going through these tasks.

225
00:16:54,405 --> 00:16:57,590
So, this is the effective way of learning by

226
00:16:57,590 --> 00:17:02,885
doing and that's why we choose to grade based on completion.

227
00:17:02,885 --> 00:17:07,070
That also means you have a lot of control over these grades,

228
00:17:07,070 --> 00:17:10,100
because you can ensure that you finish

229
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:15,265
all these tasks and then you will get most of these grades.

230
00:17:15,265 --> 00:17:21,660
The only part that will be based on the quality of solution is the tutorial presentation.

231
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:24,110
This is actually not just based on the quality of

232
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:27,020
your tutorial presenting but rather based on whether

233
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:32,930
you are software actually work as you propose.

234
00:17:32,930 --> 00:17:36,403
So, does it provide all the functions that you propose?

235
00:17:36,403 --> 00:17:38,110
Does it really work?

236
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:45,415
And this will likely affect some of the grade for tutorial presentation,

237
00:17:45,415 --> 00:17:50,405
meaning that if a software for some reason doesn't really pass our test,

238
00:17:50,405 --> 00:17:54,495
then we would deduct the points from here.

239
00:17:54,495 --> 00:18:00,945
As I said, the technology review is not actually contributing to you grade,

240
00:18:00,945 --> 00:18:06,890
but it's a metric component and it will be graded based on completion.

241
00:18:07,050 --> 00:18:12,260
We also provide up to 5% of

242
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:17,135
extra credit based on your participation in the forum discussions.

243
00:18:17,135 --> 00:18:21,680
And this is to encourage you to help

244
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:26,715
each other and particularly by answering questions posed by others.

245
00:18:26,715 --> 00:18:33,890
We will be able to use log data from the forum to give you credit,

246
00:18:33,890 --> 00:18:41,255
extra credit, and these extra credit points will be actually added to the regular points.

247
00:18:41,255 --> 00:18:43,490
So that will allow you to actually increase

248
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:49,270
your grade as will be shown here in more detail.

249
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:53,375
And this is how we are going to determine your final letter grades.

250
00:18:53,375 --> 00:18:57,980
They are based on the grade points you have collected over

251
00:18:57,980 --> 00:19:03,100
the semester using this map shown here on the slide.

252
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:09,080
Mostly it's five points for each bracket but not always.

253
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:11,825
And as you can see,

254
00:19:11,825 --> 00:19:18,980
if you have earned 5% extra credit and when adding this extra credit,

255
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:23,540
will likely help you move your grades up by one bracket,

256
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:28,020
although it won't be more than one bracket.

257
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:33,405
So, we feel that this fixed mapping would give you complete control over your grade,

258
00:19:33,405 --> 00:19:37,265
so you can monitor your grade over the semester and kind of assess

259
00:19:37,265 --> 00:19:42,590
your progress and also to adjust your schedule accordingly.

260
00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:46,845
So, this is a visualization of your workload.

261
00:19:46,845 --> 00:19:49,190
Horizontally, we show the timeline,

262
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:55,350
from the first day of instruction to the last day of instruction.

263
00:19:55,350 --> 00:20:01,730
And then vertically, you can see there are mainly six tasks for you over the semester.

264
00:20:01,730 --> 00:20:08,105
First, you will spend most of your time on watching the lecture videos,

265
00:20:08,105 --> 00:20:11,810
and this is why we have a thick black line

266
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:14,810
there that shows that most of

267
00:20:14,810 --> 00:20:18,605
your effort probably will be spent on watching lecture videos.

268
00:20:18,605 --> 00:20:22,230
And then, you will be taking 12 quizzes,

269
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:28,400
and these will be spreading over most of the semester,

270
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:36,665
corresponding to about 12 weeks when you are expected to watch those lecture videos.

271
00:20:36,665 --> 00:20:41,900
Now, we want to emphasize that you should spend most of your time to

272
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:47,636
watch videos and make sure you understand the materials before you take quizzes,

273
00:20:47,636 --> 00:20:51,455
and this will ensure that you don't leave any holes.

274
00:20:51,455 --> 00:20:57,415
If you do it the other way and by using quizzes to guide you through the lecture videos,

275
00:20:57,415 --> 00:20:59,720
then you might leave some holes,

276
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:04,075
and that might hurt your performance on exams.

277
00:21:04,075 --> 00:21:07,670
There will be two proctored exams that will be

278
00:21:07,670 --> 00:21:13,190
given in the middle of the semester and also later in the semester,

279
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:16,635
at the end of the two box.

280
00:21:16,635 --> 00:21:19,640
So, this is your third task.

281
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:21,845
The fourth task is programming assignments,

282
00:21:21,845 --> 00:21:23,600
and this will be,

283
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:27,690
again, through the entire semester,

284
00:21:27,690 --> 00:21:33,040
actually not really all the weeks in the semester,

285
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:35,352
but most of the weeks,

286
00:21:35,352 --> 00:21:40,340
because we don't want you to use up the last two weeks,

287
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:43,920
which we reserve for you to work on course project.

288
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:47,805
And the course project is the fifth component.

289
00:21:47,805 --> 00:21:51,983
And finally, you need to finish technology review.

290
00:21:51,983 --> 00:21:54,410
Now, although most of the work of

291
00:21:54,410 --> 00:21:58,485
the project is expected to be done at the end of the semester,

292
00:21:58,485 --> 00:22:02,280
you will actually start working on it from the very beginning.

293
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:04,790
And, soon after the semester starts,

294
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:08,970
we will ask you to think about the topics and you will discuss

295
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:13,985
the topics and then form teams to submit the proposal.

296
00:22:13,985 --> 00:22:17,645
But of course, during the first 12 weeks,

297
00:22:17,645 --> 00:22:21,425
you will be most occupied by the lecture videos, quizzes,

298
00:22:21,425 --> 00:22:25,704
and your assignments for programming.

299
00:22:25,704 --> 00:22:34,103
So, that's why you will likely have more time to work on the project in the end.

300
00:22:34,103 --> 00:22:40,820
The technology review is kind of designed to extend your knowledge based on your project.

301
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:43,760
But of course, you have the complete freedom

302
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:46,085
to choose whatever topic that you want to review.

303
00:22:46,085 --> 00:22:49,978
So, you don't have to tie it to the project.

304
00:22:49,978 --> 00:22:53,075
And so, we imagine that you would start

305
00:22:53,075 --> 00:22:56,865
working on it a little bit after you have decided the project,

306
00:22:56,865 --> 00:22:59,570
the topic, so that you can decide whether you want to tie

307
00:22:59,570 --> 00:23:03,552
the technology review with your project.

308
00:23:03,552 --> 00:23:07,530
So, it's good to keep this picture in mind throughout

309
00:23:07,530 --> 00:23:13,470
the semester because you might have irregular schedule sometimes.

310
00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:18,500
For example, you might find that you are very busy in the middle of the semester,

311
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:23,700
then this picture can help you adjust your schedule and the degree you

312
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:29,325
probably want to then work more on some of the tasks at the beginning of the semester,

313
00:23:29,325 --> 00:23:33,563
so that you don't overwhelm yourself in the middle of the semester.

314
00:23:33,563 --> 00:23:38,145
And similarly, if you expect to be very busy the end of the semester,

315
00:23:38,145 --> 00:23:43,030
you might want to start working on the project much earlier.

316
00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:47,100
So, I hope this picture will be always in your mind,

317
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:51,885
and you will be able to adjust your schedule accordingly

318
00:23:51,885 --> 00:23:56,955
and to particularly work on tasks proactively,

319
00:23:56,955 --> 00:23:59,820
in case you anticipate any busy time period.

320
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:07,620
Some of you have already taken maybe both MOOCs.

321
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:10,140
Now, if you are one of them,

322
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:12,910
then I think naturally,

323
00:24:12,910 --> 00:24:18,907
you will have more time to work on other problems in this course.

324
00:24:18,907 --> 00:24:22,425
So, you should take advantage of this

325
00:24:22,425 --> 00:24:28,755
to proactively finish some of the tasks much more quickly.

326
00:24:28,755 --> 00:24:34,680
In particular, since you have already watched those videos and then you can

327
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:37,500
simply review them and then you try to work on the quizzes

328
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:41,130
so that you can finish all the quizzes much more quickly.

329
00:24:41,130 --> 00:24:45,410
You may be able to finish most of the programming assignments quickly too.

330
00:24:45,410 --> 00:24:49,710
This is not only going to be helpful for you

331
00:24:49,710 --> 00:24:54,480
in the sense that you will have a lot of time to work on course project, but also,

332
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:59,070
it would allow you to help others by answering

333
00:24:59,070 --> 00:25:04,925
their questions on forums or helping them in other way,

334
00:25:04,925 --> 00:25:09,145
like teaming up with them to work on the project.

335
00:25:09,145 --> 00:25:13,890
However, I should also say that there are a few tasks that are,

336
00:25:13,890 --> 00:25:20,700
unfortunately, have very fixed time that you cannot really work on in advance.

337
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:23,640
For example, the two exams will be scheduled on

338
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:31,690
some particular dates that would have no flexibility for you to work on earlier.

339
00:25:31,690 --> 00:25:35,970
There may be some tasks in the programming assignments that have to be synchronized.

340
00:25:35,970 --> 00:25:39,605
For example, we might run competition of

341
00:25:39,605 --> 00:25:44,805
some tasks and there may be some synchronization that's needed,

342
00:25:44,805 --> 00:25:51,360
but we would like to minimize the dependency so that you

343
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:59,541
could hopefully work on many of those tasks as early as you can.

344
00:25:59,541 --> 00:26:04,070
And of course, we encourage you to use more time to finish

345
00:26:04,070 --> 00:26:08,700
a more challenging course project or to finish

346
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:15,475
a higher quality technology review.

347
00:26:15,475 --> 00:26:20,685
Now, we rely a lot on forum discussion,

348
00:26:20,685 --> 00:26:25,525
and this is because we are in different time zones

349
00:26:25,525 --> 00:26:31,495
and it's very hard to find a time that works well for everyone.

350
00:26:31,495 --> 00:26:34,825
But forum has important advantages

351
00:26:34,825 --> 00:26:40,775
of being able to accommodate everyone in the discussion.

352
00:26:40,775 --> 00:26:46,045
So, this will be the primary way of our interactions and engagement,

353
00:26:46,045 --> 00:26:49,360
and in particular, we will be using Piazza,

354
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:52,825
which is a forum that we have used for many other courses,

355
00:26:52,825 --> 00:26:59,770
and it has proven to be a useful forum with a lot of useful functions.

356
00:26:59,770 --> 00:27:03,790
The second advantage of forum is it would also enable you

357
00:27:03,790 --> 00:27:08,565
to ask your questions as soon as you have a question.

358
00:27:08,565 --> 00:27:14,400
And therefore, we can hopefully accelerate question answering and

359
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:17,020
so that you can have your question answered quickly on

360
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:23,610
the forum without waiting until office hour.

361
00:27:23,610 --> 00:27:26,620
Finally, we hope that the forum discussions would help us

362
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:30,325
identify difficult concepts in those lectures,

363
00:27:30,325 --> 00:27:34,900
so that we can focus on discussing these concepts or

364
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:40,230
explaining these concepts that are hard to understand in our office hours.

365
00:27:40,230 --> 00:27:47,775
This would make better use of our office hours to help all of you.

366
00:27:47,775 --> 00:27:51,595
Because of these reasons,

367
00:27:51,595 --> 00:27:55,792
so the protocol of question answering will be as follows,

368
00:27:55,792 --> 00:28:00,640
and we want to emphasize that it's important to

369
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:06,510
follow this protocol so that we can make effective use of our office hours,

370
00:28:06,510 --> 00:28:09,940
so that you can get your questions answered more quickly,

371
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:13,290
so that you can all help each other in learning.

372
00:28:13,290 --> 00:28:17,410
So, first, as soon as you have a question or issue to discuss,

373
00:28:17,410 --> 00:28:20,795
post it immediately on the forum.

374
00:28:20,795 --> 00:28:24,985
And this has a number of advantages, and first is,

375
00:28:24,985 --> 00:28:33,155
it will give you the opportunity to have the question answered quickly because often,

376
00:28:33,155 --> 00:28:39,480
your question may be answered by your peers or may be answered by a teacher or by me.

377
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:42,300
So, by posting the question immediately,

378
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:45,565
you have a better chance of getting the question answered quickly,

379
00:28:45,565 --> 00:28:48,055
so that you won't have to wait.

380
00:28:48,055 --> 00:28:52,945
And secondly, your question might also help others because sometimes

381
00:28:52,945 --> 00:28:55,680
other students may have a similar question or may not

382
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:58,490
realize that they have encountered this question,

383
00:28:58,490 --> 00:29:00,700
but you just articulated this question.

384
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:03,525
So, this is helpful for your peers as well.

385
00:29:03,525 --> 00:29:08,770
And discussing of this question is often also a good way to learn.

386
00:29:08,770 --> 00:29:14,085
However, if your question is not answered in a timely manner on the forum,

387
00:29:14,085 --> 00:29:16,840
or addressed adequately from your perspective,

388
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:22,810
then you should email the question to all of us including me and TAs.

389
00:29:22,810 --> 00:29:29,384
Please use a subject line that contains the keyword CS410DSO all together.

390
00:29:29,384 --> 00:29:31,015
Of course, your subject line,

391
00:29:31,015 --> 00:29:36,790
you can contain other keywords based on your question.

392
00:29:36,790 --> 00:29:40,990
And then, if you don't receive a reply

393
00:29:40,990 --> 00:29:44,730
from us by email in a timely manner, join an office-hour.

394
00:29:44,730 --> 00:29:49,330
Now, we would do our best to reply to your emails but then,

395
00:29:49,330 --> 00:29:50,945
depending on the number of emails,

396
00:29:50,945 --> 00:29:53,770
depending on our own schedule,

397
00:29:53,770 --> 00:29:59,567
we may not be able to always reply to your emails in a timely manner.

398
00:29:59,567 --> 00:30:04,285
Of course, we would do our best to respond quickly but if we can't,

399
00:30:04,285 --> 00:30:07,900
then you should come to one of our office hours.

400
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:14,375
We would try to schedule our office hours in different time slots during the day.

401
00:30:14,375 --> 00:30:17,950
For example, we would have some time slot in the morning,

402
00:30:17,950 --> 00:30:19,885
or late morning, or early afternoon,

403
00:30:19,885 --> 00:30:23,045
and then another time slot in the evening.

404
00:30:23,045 --> 00:30:25,525
And this is so that,

405
00:30:25,525 --> 00:30:29,440
we can hopefully accommodate different time zones,

406
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:35,670
because the same slot of time may not be equally convenient with all of you.

407
00:30:35,670 --> 00:30:37,518
So, we'll do our best again,

408
00:30:37,518 --> 00:30:39,470
to diversify the time slots,

409
00:30:39,470 --> 00:30:42,220
both in terms of the time in a day,

410
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:46,560
and also in terms of the days in a week.

411
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:53,705
The format of office hours is as follows, and this again,

412
00:30:53,705 --> 00:31:00,930
is based on our need to make effective use and

413
00:31:00,930 --> 00:31:09,315
the efficient use of our limited office hours to help you in the best way.

414
00:31:09,315 --> 00:31:12,135
So, we will hold weekly office hours,

415
00:31:12,135 --> 00:31:15,065
as I said, and we'll publish those time slots.

416
00:31:15,065 --> 00:31:20,420
And the office hours will be given by using video-teleconference,

417
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:22,895
and particularly using Zoom,

418
00:31:22,895 --> 00:31:27,435
and its used for system that has worked well.

419
00:31:27,435 --> 00:31:34,905
And you can join or leave an office hour at any time and that means you can join late,

420
00:31:34,905 --> 00:31:36,425
or you can leave early,

421
00:31:36,425 --> 00:31:40,085
and it's very flexible.

422
00:31:40,085 --> 00:31:45,235
So, don't feel that you always have to come at the beginning of the office hour.

423
00:31:45,235 --> 00:31:48,680
Feel free to stop by in the last ten minutes,

424
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:51,280
if that's the best time for you.

425
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:56,990
And again, by taking advantage of the forum discussion, hopefully,

426
00:31:56,990 --> 00:31:59,795
by the time of going to office hour,

427
00:31:59,795 --> 00:32:05,855
we will only need to deal with some of the relatively difficult questions.

428
00:32:05,855 --> 00:32:12,500
And the priority we will use

429
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:20,810
is to give the highest priority to any issues that have already been posted on forums,

430
00:32:20,810 --> 00:32:27,140
but have not been resolved even after some email communications.

431
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:31,760
Those are clearly the toughest issues

432
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:35,930
because it has been posted on forum without a good answer,

433
00:32:35,930 --> 00:32:41,970
and then was emailed to us and still not satisfactory solved.

434
00:32:41,970 --> 00:32:45,320
So, we would have to give those issues the highest priority,

435
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:50,660
that means if there are such issues being raised during office hour,

436
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:54,925
those issues would be given the first priority.

437
00:32:54,925 --> 00:32:59,410
After that, we'll look at the any other unresolved issues on forums.

438
00:32:59,410 --> 00:33:03,635
That's why it's very important for you to post the issue on the forum first,

439
00:33:03,635 --> 00:33:10,430
and only after resolving those issues that have already been posted

440
00:33:10,430 --> 00:33:12,665
on forums would we take

441
00:33:12,665 --> 00:33:17,440
other questions or issues that have not yet been posted on forums.

442
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:21,200
And of course, you should not

443
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:25,850
hesitate to bring any questions that you have or any issues you want to discuss.

444
00:33:25,850 --> 00:33:31,550
It's just that, we want to have a policy to prioritize the issues that we want to handle,

445
00:33:31,550 --> 00:33:34,700
so that we can provide the maximum benefit to all of

446
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:41,210
you by using our office hours efficiently.

447
00:33:41,210 --> 00:33:44,525
Finally, I want to just say something

448
00:33:44,525 --> 00:33:48,505
in general about how to get the most out of this course.

449
00:33:48,505 --> 00:33:53,810
Perhaps, the most important advice is to plan ahead based on your own schedule,

450
00:33:53,810 --> 00:33:56,210
because many of you are very busy.

451
00:33:56,210 --> 00:33:59,745
So, you want to kind of take a look at

452
00:33:59,745 --> 00:34:03,620
the picture that I showed you earlier about the tasks,

453
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:08,330
and then consider your own schedule.

454
00:34:08,330 --> 00:34:14,075
Try to imagine which periods will be a relatively busy period

455
00:34:14,075 --> 00:34:20,225
for you and identify what tasks you're supposed to work on in that period,

456
00:34:20,225 --> 00:34:23,535
and try to finish those tasks earlier,

457
00:34:23,535 --> 00:34:28,625
so that you don't overlap with yourself during that busy period.

458
00:34:28,625 --> 00:34:29,845
And of course, at any time,

459
00:34:29,845 --> 00:34:32,495
please let us know how we can help, again,

460
00:34:32,495 --> 00:34:36,365
by using the forums as the first step.

461
00:34:36,365 --> 00:34:42,410
And another thing to mention is also to allocate a sufficient time

462
00:34:42,410 --> 00:34:48,440
for the preparation of two proctored exams because they will be given only once.

463
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:51,801
That means, you only have one chance to take each exam,

464
00:34:51,801 --> 00:34:56,930
so you want to really prepare well for them.

465
00:34:56,930 --> 00:35:04,580
However, those exams are mostly to confirm that you have indeed mastered the materials.

466
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:11,015
So, they will have similar questions to the quiz questions that you have already seen.

467
00:35:11,015 --> 00:35:17,215
And in fact, some questions may be exactly the same as the questions in the quizzes.

468
00:35:17,215 --> 00:35:24,020
And we do that because this would allow you

469
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:30,618
to have some sense about what the questions might look like in the exams.

470
00:35:30,618 --> 00:35:35,535
So, they should not be much surprise if you have actually worked on

471
00:35:35,535 --> 00:35:39,140
all the questions in those quizzes and have made

472
00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:44,580
sure that you have understood the answers to those questions.

473
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:48,030
Of course, if you can,

474
00:35:48,030 --> 00:35:52,815
try to complete the quizzes and program assignments ahead of time.

475
00:35:52,815 --> 00:35:57,600
This would be to your advantage because you can now raise

476
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:59,730
your questions earlier that would allow you to have

477
00:35:59,730 --> 00:36:02,910
more time to get your questions answered.

478
00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:06,030
Therefore, by the time when you take the quiz,

479
00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:10,115
then you would have all the questions resolved.

480
00:36:10,115 --> 00:36:17,760
And it also would allow you to actively help others and to discuss any of

481
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:25,989
the problems that you have encountered that would help you earn the extra credit also.

482
00:36:25,989 --> 00:36:30,280
The second advice is to post questions on forum immediately and

483
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:35,510
whenever you have difficulty understanding any part of the course materials.

484
00:36:35,510 --> 00:36:39,975
And again, I want to emphasize the immediate action of posting any issue,

485
00:36:39,975 --> 00:36:41,640
any question on the forums.

486
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:46,375
We would do our best to resolve those issues through the forums.

487
00:36:46,375 --> 00:36:53,430
And it's the effective way to also engage the peers to help each other.

488
00:36:53,430 --> 00:36:57,390
So, do not hesitate to post questions and we

489
00:36:57,390 --> 00:37:01,290
won't to penalize you for posting many questions.

490
00:37:01,290 --> 00:37:03,578
In fact, we'll reward that perhaps,

491
00:37:03,578 --> 00:37:11,780
because that's one way to contribute to the forum discussion.

492
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:14,645
Finally, you should leverage collaborative learning,

493
00:37:14,645 --> 00:37:18,370
this is kind of related to you posting your questions on forums,

494
00:37:18,370 --> 00:37:23,185
and again, to actively participate in the forum discussion.

495
00:37:23,185 --> 00:37:27,345
You will actually learn a lot from reading other people's posts,

496
00:37:27,345 --> 00:37:29,880
even if you know the answers because they are

497
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:33,515
often opinions expressed about those materials.

498
00:37:33,515 --> 00:37:36,960
So, we do hope that you have active discussion on

499
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:40,763
forums to help each other and to help each other, particularly,

500
00:37:40,763 --> 00:37:44,550
to save time, to understand the difficult concepts,

501
00:37:44,550 --> 00:37:47,340
to do well in the quizzes and exams,

502
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:51,220
and to finish assignments smoothly.

503
00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:56,845
And finally, we do encourage you to help each other understand materials too.

504
00:37:56,845 --> 00:38:01,320
So, we encourage you to answer others' questions,

505
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:05,005
and the system will record those answers.

506
00:38:05,005 --> 00:38:07,069
We'll have a statistics about that,

507
00:38:07,069 --> 00:38:11,255
and then we'll use that to give extra credit.

508
00:38:11,255 --> 00:38:15,745
So, this was just the overall introduction to the course.
