1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,073
[SOUND]
So

2
00:00:06,073 --> 00:00:13,035
we talked about PageRank as
a way to capture the assault.

3
00:00:14,155 --> 00:00:21,245
Now, we also looked at some other examples
where a hub might be interesting.

4
00:00:21,245 --> 00:00:24,425
So there is another algorithm called HITS,
and

5
00:00:24,425 --> 00:00:28,257
that going to compute the scores for
authorities and hubs.

6
00:00:28,257 --> 00:00:33,167
The intuitions are pages that are widely
cited are good authorities and

7
00:00:33,167 --> 00:00:38,577
whereas pages that cite many
other pages are good hubs.

8
00:00:38,577 --> 00:00:42,650
I think that the most interesting
idea of this algorithm HITS,

9
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:46,930
is it's going to use
a reinforcement mechanism

10
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:51,470
to kind of help improve the scoring for
hubs and the authorities.

11
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:53,318
And so here's the idea,

12
00:00:53,318 --> 00:00:57,809
it was assumed that good
authorities are cited by good hubs.

13
00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:03,847
That means if you are cited by many
pages with good hub scores then

14
00:01:03,847 --> 00:01:07,266
that inquiry says, you're an authority.

15
00:01:07,266 --> 00:01:11,740
And similarly, good hubs are those
that point at good authorities.

16
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:15,560
So if you pointed to a lot
of good authority pages,

17
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:17,880
then your hubs score would be increased.

18
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:22,115
So then you will have literally reinforced
each other, because you have pointed so

19
00:01:22,115 --> 00:01:22,968
some good hubs.

20
00:01:22,968 --> 00:01:27,635
And so you have pointed to some good
authorities to get a good hubs score,

21
00:01:27,635 --> 00:01:30,544
whereas those authority
scores would be also

22
00:01:30,544 --> 00:01:34,736
improved because they
are pointing to by a good hub.

23
00:01:34,736 --> 00:01:39,380
And this is algorithms is also general it
can have many applications in graph and

24
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:40,730
network analysis.

25
00:01:40,730 --> 00:01:43,170
So just briefly, here's how it works.

26
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:47,090
We first also construct a matrix, but this
time we're going to construct an adjacent

27
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:49,750
matrix and
we're not going to normalize the values.

28
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:54,100
So if there's a link there's a 1,
if there's no link that's 0.

29
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:56,185
Again, it's the same graph.

30
00:01:56,185 --> 00:02:01,335
And then we're going to
define the hubs score of page

31
00:02:01,335 --> 00:02:06,955
as the sum of the authority scores of
all the pages that it appoints to.

32
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:09,620
So whether you are hub,

33
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:14,430
really depends on whether you are pointing
to a lot of good authority pages.

34
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:17,080
That's what it says in the first equation.

35
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:22,130
In the second equation,
we define the authorities of a page

36
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:27,350
as a sum of the hub scores of all
those pages that appoint to you.

37
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:30,260
So whether you are good authority
would depend on whether those

38
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:33,420
pages that are pointing
to you are good hubs.

39
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:37,380
So you can see this forms
iterative reinforcement mechanism.

40
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:44,586
Now, these three questions can be
also written in the metrics format.

41
00:02:44,586 --> 00:02:50,707
So what we get here is then the hub
vector is equal to the product

42
00:02:50,707 --> 00:02:55,770
of the adjacency matrix and
the authority vector,

43
00:02:55,770 --> 00:03:00,026
and this is basically the first equation.

44
00:03:00,026 --> 00:03:05,292
And similarly, the second equation
can be returned as the authority

45
00:03:05,292 --> 00:03:11,034
vector is equal to the product of
a transpose multiplied by the hub vector.

46
00:03:11,034 --> 00:03:15,820
Now, these are just different ways
of expressing these equations.

47
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:19,967
But what's interesting is that
if you look at the matrix form,

48
00:03:19,967 --> 00:03:26,680
you can also plug in the authority
equation into the first one.

49
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:31,500
So if you do that, you have actually
eliminated the authority vector completely

50
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,930
and you get the equations
of only hubs scores.

51
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:39,032
The hubs score vector is
equal to a multiplied

52
00:03:39,032 --> 00:03:43,522
by a transpose multiplied
by the hub score again.

53
00:03:43,522 --> 00:03:47,511
Similarly, we can do a transformation
to have equation for

54
00:03:47,511 --> 00:03:49,440
just the authorities also.

55
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:54,370
So although we frame the problem
as computing hubs and authorities,

56
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:58,410
we can actually eliminate one of them to
obtain equation just for one of them.

57
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:03,810
Now, the difference between this and page
random is that now the matrix is actually

58
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:07,960
a multiplication of the adjacency
matrix and it's transpose.

59
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,840
So this is different from page rank.

60
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:15,373
But mathematically, then we will
be computing the same problem.

61
00:04:15,373 --> 00:04:19,777
So in HITS,
we typically would initialize the values.

62
00:04:19,777 --> 00:04:22,215
Let's say, 1 for all these values, and

63
00:04:22,215 --> 00:04:26,580
then we would iteratively apply
these equations, essentially.

64
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:33,100
And this is equivalent to multiply
that by the metrics a and a transpose.

65
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,740
So the arrows of these is exactly
the same in the PageRank.

66
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:43,035
But here because the adjacency
matrix is not normalized.

67
00:04:43,035 --> 00:04:47,463
So what we have to do is after each
iteration we're going to normalize, and

68
00:04:47,463 --> 00:04:50,980
this would allow us to
control the growth of value.

69
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:53,671
Otherwise they would grow larger and
larger.

70
00:04:53,671 --> 00:04:57,180
And if we do that, and
that will basically get HITS.

71
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:03,920
That was the computer, the hubs scores,
and authority scores for all the pages.

72
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:08,647
And these scores can then be used in
branching just like the PageRank scores.

73
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:14,525
So to summarize in this lecture, we have
seen that link information's very useful.

74
00:05:14,525 --> 00:05:19,302
In particular,
the anchor text is very useful to

75
00:05:19,302 --> 00:05:23,737
increase the text
representation of a page.

76
00:05:23,737 --> 00:05:25,959
And we also talk about the PageRank and

77
00:05:25,959 --> 00:05:29,380
page anchor as two major
link analysis algorithms.

78
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:35,930
Both can generate scores for web pages
that can be used in the ranking function.

79
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:39,600
Note that PageRank and
the HITS are also very general algorithms.

80
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:46,663
So they have many applications in
analyzing other graphs or networks.

81
00:05:46,663 --> 00:05:56,663
