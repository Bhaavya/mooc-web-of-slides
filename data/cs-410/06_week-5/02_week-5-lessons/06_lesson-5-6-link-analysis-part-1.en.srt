00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:06,042
[SOUND] This lecture is about

2
00:00:06,042 --> 00:00:12,849
link analysis for web search.

3
00:00:12,849 --> 00:00:18,236
In this lecture, we're going to talk
about the web search and particularly,

4
00:00:18,236 --> 00:00:23,310
focusing on how to do link analysis and
use the results to improve search.

5
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:31,220
The main topic of this lecture is to look
at the ranking algorithms for Web Search.

6
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:35,660
In the previous lecture we talked
about how to create index.

7
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:42,992
Now that we have index, we want to see
how we can improve ranking of Pages.

8
00:00:42,992 --> 00:00:44,900
The web.

9
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:48,320
Now standard IR models,
can be also applied here.

10
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:51,410
In fact,
they are important building blocks, for,

11
00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:54,390
improve, for supporting web search.

12
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:56,380
But they aren't sufficient.

13
00:00:56,380 --> 00:00:58,550
And mainly for the following reasons.

14
00:00:58,550 --> 00:01:02,630
First, on the web, we tend to have
very different information needs, for

15
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:07,150
example, people might search for
a webpage, or an entry page.

16
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:11,230
And this is different from
the traditional library search,

17
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:15,870
where people are primarily interested
in collecting literature Information.

18
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:19,070
So this kind of query is often
called a navigational queries.

19
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:23,250
The purpose is to navigate into
a particular type of the page.

20
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:28,255
So for such queries we might benefit
from using link information.

21
00:01:28,255 --> 00:01:33,020
Secondly, documents have additional
information and on the web pages,

22
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:37,220
are web format,
there are a lot of other clues,

23
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:40,538
such as the layout, the title,
or link information again.

24
00:01:40,538 --> 00:01:45,340
So this has provided opportunity to use

25
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:49,800
extra context information of
the document to improve the scoring.

26
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:52,440
And finally,
information quality varies a lot.

27
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:56,570
That means we have to consider
many factors to improve

28
00:01:56,570 --> 00:01:58,400
the range in the algorithm.

29
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:03,540
This would give us a more robust way
to rank pages, making it harder for

30
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:09,350
any spammer to just manipulate the one
signal to improve the ranking of a page.

31
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:11,370
So as a result,

32
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:15,500
people have made a number of major
extensions to the ranking algorithms.

33
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:21,380
One line is to exploit
links to improve scoring.

34
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:24,790
And that's the main topic of this lecture.

35
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:31,260
People have also proposed algorithms to
exploit the loudest, they are implicit.

36
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:35,370
Feedback information the form of
click throughs and that's of course

37
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:40,720
in the category of feedback techniques and
machine all is often used there.

38
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:45,009
In general in web search the ranking
algorithms are based on machine learning

39
00:02:45,009 --> 00:02:49,750
algorithms to combine
all kinds of features.

40
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:55,509
Many of them are based on
the standard of virtual models such

41
00:02:55,509 --> 00:03:03,341
as BM25 that we talked about [INAUDIBLE]
to score different parts of documents or

42
00:03:03,341 --> 00:03:09,217
to provide additional features
based on content matching,

43
00:03:09,217 --> 00:03:13,364
but link information
is also very useful so

44
00:03:13,364 --> 00:03:17,660
they provide additional scoring signals.

45
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:21,080
So let's look at links in
more detail on the web.

46
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:26,450
So this is a snapshot of some
part of the web, let's say.

47
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:30,790
So we can see there are many links that
link the different pages together.

48
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:35,730
And in this case, you can also
look at the center here, there is

49
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:40,400
a description of a link that's pointing
to the document on the right side.

50
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,850
Now, this description text
is called anchor text.

51
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:48,920
Now if you think about this text,
it's actually quite useful

52
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:53,865
because it provides some extra
description of that page be points with.

53
00:03:53,865 --> 00:03:59,685
So for example, if someone wants
to bookmark Amazon.com front page

54
00:03:59,685 --> 00:04:04,555
the person might say the biggest
online bookstore and

55
00:04:04,555 --> 00:04:07,695
then the link to Amazon, right?

56
00:04:07,695 --> 00:04:11,855
So, the description here after is very
similar to what the user would type in

57
00:04:11,855 --> 00:04:14,350
the query box when they are looking for
or such a page.

58
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:19,950
And that's why it's very useful for
managing pages.

59
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:25,058
Suppose someone types in
the query like online bookstore or

60
00:04:25,058 --> 00:04:27,517
biggest online bookstore.

61
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:35,980
All right the query would match
this anchor text in the page here.

62
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:39,650
And then this actually
provides evidence for

63
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:44,090
matching the page that's being
pointed to that is the Amazon.

64
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:45,650
a entry page.

65
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:50,120
So if you match anchor text that
describes an anchor to a page,

66
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:58,080
actually that provides good evidence for
the elements of the page being pointed to.

67
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,480
So anchor text is very useful.

68
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:03,970
If you look at the bottom part of this
picture you can also see there are some

69
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:08,380
patterns of some links and these links
might indicate the utility of a document.

70
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:09,230
So for example,

71
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:14,200
on the right side you'll see this
page has received the many inlinks.

72
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:17,180
Now that means many other pages
are pointing to this page.

73
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:20,270
This shows that this page is quite useful.

74
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:24,710
On the left side you can see this
is another page that points to

75
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:25,920
many other pages.

76
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:29,040
So this is a director page
that would allow you to

77
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:31,260
actually see a lot of other pages.

78
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:35,990
So we can call the first
case authority page and

79
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:41,250
the second case half page, but this means
the link information can help intuit.

80
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:44,080
One is to provide extra text for matching.

81
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:49,750
The other is to provide some
additional scores for the webpage

82
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:53,980
to characterize how likely a page is
a hub, how likely a page is a authority.

83
00:05:55,820 --> 00:06:02,530
So people then of course and proposed
ideas to leverage this link information.

84
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:08,030
Google's PageRank which was the main
technique that they used in early days

85
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:13,360
is a good example and
that is an algorithm to capture page and

86
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:17,070
popularity, basically to score authority.

87
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:21,640
So the intuitions here are links
are just like citations in literature.

88
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:24,030
Now think about one page
pointing you to another page,

89
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:27,440
this is very similar to one
paper citing another paper.

90
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:30,360
So, of course then,
if a page is cited often,

91
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:33,920
then we can assume this page
to be more useful in general.

92
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,570
So that's a very good intuition.

93
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:42,950
Now PageRank is essentially to take
advantage of this Intuition to

94
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:46,650
implement with the principal approach.

95
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:51,980
Intuitively, it is essentially doing
citation counting or in link counting.

96
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:56,390
It just improves the simple
idea in two ways.

97
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:59,420
One it will consider indirect citations.

98
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:04,010
So that means you don't just look
at how many in links you have.

99
00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:08,550
You also look at what are those
pages that are pointing to you.

100
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:13,530
If those pages themselves have a lot
of in-links, that means a lot.

101
00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:16,750
In some sense,
you will get some credit from that.

102
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:20,080
But if those pages that
are pointing to you are not

103
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:25,095
being pointed to by other pages they
themselves don't have many in-links,

104
00:07:25,095 --> 00:07:27,360
then well, you don't get that much.

105
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,830
So that's the idea of
getting indirect citation.

106
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:31,770
All right, so

107
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:37,060
you can also understand this idea by
looking at again the research papers.

108
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:42,082
If you're cited by let's say ten papers,
and those ten papers

109
00:07:42,082 --> 00:07:48,450
are just workshop papers or some papers
that are not very influential, right?

110
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:54,340
So although you've got ten in-links,
and that's not as good as if you

111
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:59,910
are cited by ten papers that themselves
have attracted a lot of other citations.

112
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:06,563
And so in this case where we would
like to consider indirect links and

113
00:08:06,563 --> 00:08:08,530
page does that.

114
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:12,174
The other idea is it's
good to pseudo citations.

115
00:08:13,810 --> 00:08:21,120
Assume that basically every page is having
a number zero pseudo citation count.

116
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,950
Essentially you are trying to
imagine there are many virtual

117
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:27,510
links that will link all
the pages together so

118
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:32,740
that you actually get the pseudo
citations from everyone.

119
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:36,760
The reason why they want to do that.

120
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:41,980
Is this will allow them
to solve the problem

121
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:47,348
elegantly with linear algebra technique.

122
00:08:47,348 --> 00:08:52,354
So, I think maybe the best
way to understand

123
00:08:52,354 --> 00:08:58,172
the PageRank is to think
of this as through computer

124
00:08:58,172 --> 00:09:04,549
probability of random surfer
visiting every webpage.

125
00:09:04,549 --> 00:09:14,549
