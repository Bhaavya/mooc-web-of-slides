  Week 4 Overview
 </h1>
 <p>
  During this week's lessons, you will learn probabilistic retrieval models and statistical language models,
particularly the detail of the query likelihood retrieval function with two
specific smoothing methods, and how the query likelihood retrieval function is
connected with the retrieval heuristics used in the vector space model.

 </p>
 <ul bullettype="bullets">

   <p>
    Explain how to interpret the conditional probability p(q|d) used for scoring documents in the query likelihood retrieval function.

  Tips for Success
 </h2>
 <p>
  To do well this week, I recommend that you do the following:
 </p>
 <ul bullettype="bullets">
  <li>
   <p>
    Review the video lectures a number of times to gain a solid understanding of the key questions and concepts introduced this week.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    When possible, provide tips and suggestions to your peers in this class. As a learning community, we can help each other learn and grow. One way of doing this is by helping to address the questions that your peers pose. By engaging with each other, we’ll all learn better.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    It’s always a good idea to refer to the video lectures and chapter readings we've read during this week and reference them in your responses. When appropriate, critique the information presented.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Take notes while you read the materials and watch the lectures for this week. By taking notes, you are interacting with the material and will find that it is easier to remember and to understand. With your notes, you’ll also find that it’s easier to complete your assignments. So, go ahead, do yourself a favor; take some notes!
