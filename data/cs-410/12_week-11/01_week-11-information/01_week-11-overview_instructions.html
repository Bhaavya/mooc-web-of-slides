  Week 11 Overview
 </h1>
 <p>
  During this week's lessons, you will continue learning about various methods for text categorization, particularly discriminative qualifiers, and you will also learn sentiment analysis and opinion mining, including a detailed introduction to a particular technique for sentiment classification (i.e., ordinal regression).

  Goals and Objectives
 </h2>
 <p>
  After you actively engage in the learning experiences in this module, you should be able to:
 </p>
 <ul bullettype="bullets">
  <li>
   <p>
    Explain the basic ideas of Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), and how K-NN works.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Explain how to evaluate categorization results.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Explain the tasks of opinion mining and sentiment analysis and why they are important tasks from an application perspective.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Explain how sentiment analysis can be done using text categorization techniques and why a straightforward application of regular text categorization techniques may not be adequate.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Give examples of both simple and complex features that are used for characterizing text data and explain how NLP can enable complex features to be generated from text.
   </p>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <h2 level="2">

   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Why are unigram features generally insufficient for accurate sentiment classification?
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    What’s the concern of using too many complex features such as frequent substructures of parse trees?

  Tips for Success
 </h2>
 <p>
  To do well this week, I recommend that you do the following:
 </p>
 <ul bullettype="bullets">
  <li>
   <p>
    Review the video lectures a number of times to gain a solid understanding of the key questions and concepts introduced this week.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    When possible, provide tips and suggestions to your peers in this class. As a learning community, we can help each other learn and grow. One way of doing this is by helping to address the questions that your peers pose. By engaging with each other, we’ll all learn better.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    It’s always a good idea to refer to the video lectures and chapter readings we've read during this week and reference them in your responses. When appropriate, critique the information presented.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Take notes while you read the materials and watch the lectures for this week. By taking notes, you are interacting with the material and will find that it is easier to remember and to understand. With your notes, you’ll also find that it’s easier to complete your assignments. So, go ahead, do yourself a favor; take some notes!
