  Week 6 Overview
 </h1>
 <p>
  During this week's lessons, you will learn how machine learning can be used to combine multiple scoring factors to optimize ranking of documents in web search (i.e., learning to rank), and learn techniques used in recommender systems (also called filtering systems), including content-based recommendation/filtering and collaborative filtering. You will also have a chance to review all the text retrieval content.

  Tips for Success
 </h2>
 <p>
  To do well this week, I recommend that you do the following:
 </p>
 <ul bullettype="bullets">
  <li>
   <p>
    Review the video lectures a number of times to gain a solid understanding of the key questions and concepts introduced this week.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    When possible, provide tips and suggestions to your peers in this class. As a learning community, we can help each other learn and grow. One way of doing this is by helping to address the questions that your peers pose. By engaging with each other, we’ll all learn better.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    It’s always a good idea to refer to the video lectures and chapter readings we've read during this week and reference them in your responses. When appropriate, critique the information presented.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Take notes while you read the materials and watch the lectures for this week. By taking notes, you are interacting with the material and will find that it is easier to remember and to understand. With your notes, you’ll also find that it’s easier to complete your assignments. So, go ahead, do yourself a favor; take some notes!
   </p>
  </li>
 </ul>
